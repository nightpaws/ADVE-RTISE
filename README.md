Attention Deficit Virtually Eliminated: the Reintroduction of Teaching Innovation in a Social-networking Environment


##Initial Description
There is little doubt that the Internet underpins many innovations in teaching and learning. There is also little doubt that the Internet is also used to deliver entertainment and other forms of social interaction/distraction. The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of services like YouTube and Facebook to support teaching and learning.

It is envisaged that the system would be developed in a way that enables staff and students to augment normal academic content delivery and feedback systems with these types of social-networking systems. However, it is not proposed that the the likes of YouTube and Facebook would be used to replace the current systems but, rather, provide an additional avenue for the content to be 'advertised'.

###Alternative Names:
Since the above specification is very open-ended some of the following project titles may be better suited to the eventual focus and outcome of the final project!:

- VERSATILITY [Virtual Environments Reinforcing Student Attention in Teaching with Immersive Learning Innovations and Technologies like YouTube]
- ALERTED [Advanced Learning Environment to Reinforce Educational Development]
- RATIO:SN [Reinforce Attention with Teaching Innovations and Originality: Social Networking]
