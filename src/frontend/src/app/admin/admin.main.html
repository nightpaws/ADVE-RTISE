<!--I need to change the id's on this so that it runs separate from main ui-->
<div id="admin-main" class="scrollable">
    <div class="tile" id="admin-welcome">
        <h1>Admin Area</h1>
        <p>This feature has not been implemented.<br>
            But this area would be used to manage accounts</p>
    </div>
