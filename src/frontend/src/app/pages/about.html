        <h2>Initial Description</h2>
        <p>There is little doubt that the Internet underpins many innovations in teaching and learning. There is also
            little doubt that the Internet is also used to deliver entertainment and other forms of social
            interaction/distraction. The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of services like YouTube
            and Facebook to support teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>It is envisaged that the system would be developed in a way that enables staff and students to augment normal
            academic content delivery and feedback systems with these types of social-networking systems. However, it is
            not proposed that the the likes of YouTube and Facebook would be used to replace the current systems but,
            rather, provide an additional avenue for the content to be 'advertised'.</p>
        <h3>Alternative Names:</h3>
        <p>Since the above specification is very open-ended some of the following project titles may be better suited to
            the eventual focus and outcome of the final project!:</p>

            <li>VERSATILITY [Virtual Environments Reinforcing Student Attention in Teaching with Immersive Learning
                Innovations and Technologies like YouTube]
